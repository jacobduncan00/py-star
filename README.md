# A* Path Finding Visualization in Python

This A* Path Finding visualizer writting in Python 3 is designed with pygame and uses the manhattan distance for calculating the heuristic.
Therefore, A* is guaranteed to find a shortest path. Other heuristic methods have proven better but manhattan distance is very simple which is why I used it.
